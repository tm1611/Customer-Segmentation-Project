# Customer Segmentation Project

This repo contains the jupyter notebook of the *Customer Segmentation Project* which is a component of the *Data Scientist Nanodegree* by Udacity. Unsupervised methods are applied to customer data of Arvato Bertelsmann in order to identify and characterize certain customer segments. The data is proprietary so I am not allowed to share it.
